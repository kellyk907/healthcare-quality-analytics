and surfaces disparities through stratified reporting.

## Measures Included
- Preventive Screening (Mammogram-style)
- Diabetes Care (HbA1c Testing)

## Tools
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- SQL (SQLite)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Healthcare analytics
- Quality measure logic
- SQL querying and validation
- Health equity stratification
- Data visualization

## Data Note
All data used in this project is fully synthetic and safe for public sharing.
